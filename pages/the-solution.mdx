# ðŸ’¡ The solution

To solve the adoption problem we are build a non-custodial wallet that ditches the need of EOA (externally owned accounts) and in consecuence the need of storing seedphrases. Allows users to recover their account via a system of guardians (social recovery), pay their tx's with ERC-20 tokens (for example: DAI, USDC or NUARS) and sign using their preffered methods.

What are the benefits of this solution?

- No need to deal with seed-phrases
- User can recover their account in case of device loss or compromise
- Users own their funds.
- Makes default onboarding to custodial solutions easier.

Finally before discussing how everything works, bear in mind we are not reinventing the wheel in terms of innovation. That work has been done and continues to do so by researchers, developers, contributors and the community as a whole. We are a bunch of builder who want to solve our everyday problems and found in this implementations a way to do so, in that regard we will boil down the explanation and functioning of the different methods and technologies we are implementing and try to keep it as simple as possible.
